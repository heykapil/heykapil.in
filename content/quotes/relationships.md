1. Love yourself.
2. Patience. Control your emotions, specially **Anger**.
3. Be slow while choosing your partner. Don't commit early (specially when everything is looking/being too good, everyone praising etc.), sometimes people wear masks, and it takes time for that mask to fall off. 
4. Don't be available all the time for anyone. Sometimes, absence is what increases cravings. But make sure you give the assurance of your presence in the absence of you.
5. All major life decisions involve money. Marriage and children especially.
6. You can not change someone's behaviour, be it your wife, girlfriend or other, by any means love, fight, or anything else. You can only work on yourself. Adapt yourself to these things and prefer mental peace.
7. Learn to walk away where you are not respected, be it from your most loved person. Self-respect is way above than anything.
8. No one loves you, (be it your partner/parents/friends) everyone is with you for some kind of reason(s) — there is something involved (big or small) which you are providing so as they are with you. The day you remove this (these) thing(s), everyone will leave you.
9. The more fucked up your brain is, the more fucked up your relationship gets. Cool down.
10. Never try to control another to forever keep them close to yourself, other feels like you are suffocating them. Whoever you love, set them free.
11. Those who are not part of your struggle (be it anyone), should not be the part of your success (money/fame/anything else).
12. Communication is one thing, but your tone while communicating is everything.
13. Never lend money to your friends and relatives (including your in-laws). Forget about the money (it's not coming back to you), even your relationship with your friend/relative going to be soon worse/finished. Don't even be the guarantor of their loans.
14. You’re not special. You’re quite an average person. Don’t try to be an exception-you’ll fail.
15. Looks do matter, so go to the gym, burn fat, be in good shape and get some muscles. Wear and smell good.
